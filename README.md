PRT Status for Android
=====

This android application is to help students at West Virginia University track the uptime status of the [Personal Rapid Transit \(PRT\)](https://transportation.wvu.edu/prt).

It currently isn't in much of a running state as I've got to finish the Google Cloud Messaging server component to send the payloads out to the devices via GCM. That project can be found [here](/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-go).

I will update this readnme and repository with builds, links, changelogs, and current issues at a later date nearing release.
