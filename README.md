PRT Status for Android
=====

![prt_promotion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-android/master/artwork/listing-promo.png)

[As featured on WVUToday](http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2014/08/15/student-employee-develops-wvu-prt-status-app-to-alert-riders-about-service), this android application is to help students at West Virginia University track the uptime status of the [Personal Rapid Transit \(PRT\)](https://transportation.wvu.edu/prt).

This app uses Google Cloud Messaging to receive payloads directly from my GCM server (found [here](https://github.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-go), written in Go).

You can also find nightly versions (versions which are live and supported but aren't available on the Google Play Store just yet) on the [releases page](https://github.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-android/releases) of this repository.

### Credits

Myself, [Austin Dizzy](https://austindizzy.me) ([@AustinDizzy](https://twitter.com/AustinDizzy)) - It didn't take me very long to make this app, but I'm still proud of it. Something small that I did can potentially benefit many students and help to make their first year, or even their last year, in college just a little less stressful.

[Dave Olsen](http://dmolsen.com/) ([@dmolsen](https://twitter.com/dmolsen)) - For providing the initial idea(s) and helping my initial development by providing me with the PRT API and fixing a few bugs in the PRT API that made prototyping all that much easier. Dave also helped me get through WVU's Trademark and Licensing legal group quick and smooth enough so that I could launch the app just as students were arriving back on campus.

[Vicki Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/vicki-smith/a/558/67b) ([@MissVickiWV](https://twitter.com/MissVickiWV)) - Vicki helped me push news of my app to the entire student body by posting it across WVU's mediums of public communication. Getting the [article posted on WVU Today](http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/n/2014/08/15/student-employee-develops-wvu-prt-status-app-to-alert-riders-about-service), [tweeting and spreading](https://twitter.com/WVUNewsFeed/status/500298359274364928) the [news over twitter](https://twitter.com/wvuoit/status/500312181754560512), and [making sure students had a way to notice it](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10152185949546269&id=23556496268) before beginning their journey with the spotty PRT.
