PRT Status for Android
=====

![prt_promotion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-android/master/artwork/prt_promotion.png)

This android application is to help students at West Virginia University track the uptime status of the [Personal Rapid Transit \(PRT\)](https://transportation.wvu.edu/prt).

This app uses Google Cloud Messaging to receive payloads directly from my GCM server (found [here](https://github.com/AustinDizzy/prtstatus-go), written in Go). It has yet to be pushed to the Google Play store, but builds can be found under this project repo's releases.

I will update this page with a Google Play link as soon as I've got it uploaded.

I will update this readnme and repository with builds, links, changelogs, and current issues at a later date nearing full release.
